\arguments{
\item{iso3}{Character. ISO3 country code (e.g., \code{"FRA"}).}

\item{country}{Character. Country name.}

\item{disease}{Character. Disease name.}

\item{animal_category}{Character. A high-level category label (e.g., \code{"livestock"}, \code{"wildlife"}).}

\item{species}{Character. Target animal species.}

\item{disease_notification}{Integer (0 or 1). Is disease notification mandatory?}

\item{targeted_surveillance}{Integer (0 or 1). Is targeted surveillance applied?}

\item{general_surveillance}{Integer (0 or 1). Is general surveillance applied?}

\item{screening}{Integer (0 or 1). Are screening measures in place?}

\item{precautions_at_the_borders}{Integer (0 or 1). Are there border precautions?}

\item{slaughter}{Integer (0 or 1). Is emergency slaughter used as a control measure?}

\item{selective_killing_and_disposal}{Integer (0 or 1). Are infected animals selectively killed and disposed?}

\item{zoning}{Integer (0 or 1). Is zoning or compartmentalization used?}

\item{official_vaccination}{Integer (0 or 1). Is official vaccination used?}

\item{last_outbreak_end_date}{Date or character convertible to Date. The date when the last known outbreak ended.}

\item{commerce_illegal}{Integer (0, 1, or 3). Risk score for illegal animal commerce (higher is riskier).}

\item{commerce_legal}{Integer (0, 1, or 3). Risk score for legal animal commerce.}

\item{data_source}{Character. Describes the data source, defaulting to the user name and current date.}
}
\value{
A 1-row \link[tibble:tibble]{tibble::tibble} object with cleaned, validated, and structured emission risk factor data.
The object includes an attribute \code{"datatype" = "erf_table"} for downstream compatibility.
}
\description{
Constructs and validates a single row of emission risk factor data for a given country, species, and disease context.
This function serves as a robust helper to generate new entries in the emission risk factors dataset, ensuring
compatibility with subsequent analytical workflows in the \code{\link{riskintroanalysis}} package.
}
\details{
The function performs input validation and data cleaning (e.g., coercing numeric fields to integer) and assigns
appropriate data types. It ensures the output meets the schema expected by the emission risk scoring system, which
uses this data to calculate risk scores across four weighted domains:
\itemize{
\item Epidemiological status (e.g., \code{last_outbreak_end_date})
\item Surveillance measures (e.g., \code{disease_notification}, \code{targeted_surveillance}, \code{general_surveillance}, \code{screening})
\item Control measures (e.g., \code{slaughter}, \code{zoning}, \code{official_vaccination})
\item Animal commerce (e.g., \code{commerce_illegal}, \code{commerce_legal})
}

The resulting row includes domain-specific fields that will be used by scoring algorithms such as \code{build_emission_risk_table()}
to derive intermediate and final emission risk values.

The returned tibble is validated against the expected schema using \code{validate_table_content()} and
\code{validate_table_content_cli_msg()}. Any coercions or type fixes are handled internally via helper functions like
\code{if_numeric_to_int()}.
